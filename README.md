## 📊 Key Insights

Top Performing Specialties:
Identify which medical specialties receive the highest patient footfall across years.

Age Group Distribution:
Understand which age group (children, adults, seniors) contributes most to hospital visits and how their patterns differ.

Geographic Analysis:
Discover which districts have the highest patient volumes and how regional healthcare demand changes over time.

Visit Recency Behavior:
Analyze how recently patients have interacted with the healthcare system — most visits tend to fall within a short time band.

Seasonal Patterns:
Spot patterns in patient activity across different quarters of the year, especially spikes in the latter half.

Year-on-Year Change:
Observe how patient volumes grow or decline year over year with percentage-based KPIs.
